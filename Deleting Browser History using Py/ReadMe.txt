This is a Simple project which deletes the Browsing History of Chrome based on the Keyword Entered.
If the following keyword gets found in the history database then our code automatically deletes the url's 
associated with that respective keywords.
Point to be noted here is when you are trying to delete browsing history from chrome while remainig signed in
then after some seconds Chrome's gonna restore that history from your Logged in id.
So, it's better to logout from current account in chrome then try to run the file test.py .

The Location of the History file of chrome is available in the code.
